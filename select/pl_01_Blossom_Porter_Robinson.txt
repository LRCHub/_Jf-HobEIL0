I close my eyes, for once
I don't have to try
And while wishing for a life,
I picture you happy, oh
In the weeds we walked,
your hand running through
the moss
I was so lost in thought
but you were there laughing
You've taken me with you
Can I slow the days?
I wish that I'll find the faith
I'm dying, I'll save your place
and you'll never suffer
We'll stay together
Oh, it's not alright,
that one day
we're all out of time
I'll write you another life,
I'm sorry for crying
It's just that I love you
'One day' can't be far enough
I had lost my sight
So you sing to me the beauty
you'd been seeing
If I can't stop time
and build a world where
God cannot take us
There's no need to think of time
But then you said:
"Don't think of the time
that's left
You're spending it in your head,
I just want you laughing"
I'm sorry for crying,
I just want you happy
So at last, goodbye
I'll be happy
just to have known you
And we wished each other well
